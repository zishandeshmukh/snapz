# SnapMind Mobile — React Native skeleton

This folder contains a minimal React Native app skeleton that mirrors the web frontend's core list of memories and includes a helper to POST mobile shares to the backend `/mobile/share` endpoint.

Important notes before running
- This is a skeleton for RN CLI (not Expo). You must have Android Studio + SDK installed to run on Android emulator.
- Edit `src/lib/config.js` and set `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to your project's anon key (copy from `Frontend/.env` VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY). The `SUPABASE_URL` is already set to your project.
- Set `BACKEND_BASE` to your backend host. When testing on Android emulator use `http://10.0.2.2:3001`.
- If your backend uses `MOBILE_API_KEY`, pass it to `sendShare` via the `apiKey` argument.

Run locally (Windows + Android emulator)

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd MobileApp
npm install
```

2. Start Metro and run on Android emulator

```powershell
npm run start
npm run android
```

3. Test
- Pull-to-refresh the list to load memories from Supabase.
- To test the share flow, use the `sendShare` helper from `src/lib/api.js` in your code or wire up a share-target plugin (see notes below).

Share-target integration (native)
- To make the app appear in the Android/iOS share sheet you'll need to add a native share-target extension. Popular packages:
  - `react-native-share-menu` (Android + iOS) — requires manual native installation steps.
  - `react-native-receive-sharing-intent` (Android + iOS) — well-documented but requires native config.
- After installing the module, follow the package README for native manifest/Info.plist edits. In the share handler, call `sendShare(payload, apiKey)` to forward the share to `/mobile/share`.

Next steps I can do for you
- Fully wire a share extension (Android + iOS) with native edits and example share UI.
- Implement user auth and attach memories to user accounts.
- Create RN screens for Search, Timeline, QuickAdd, Analytics to mirror the web UI exactly.
